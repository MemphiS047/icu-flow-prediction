## ICU Flow Prediction
This repository contians a comprehensive model for "end-to-end" patient flow prediction in ICU environement. Available notebooks use MIMIC-III date for preprocessing and model training. 

## Extracting the Training Datasets
To extract the dataset you need to have MIMIC-III on your preferred DBMS. For this specific study we recommend using Postgres. Below SQL scripts provide creates dataset tables then you can export them with preferred file types and configuration via DBMS or either run the extract.py script

## Referencing
Be sure to use below reference when you will use it in your study.
