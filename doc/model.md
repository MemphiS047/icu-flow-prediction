# Preface
Depending on the approach there are few models that we can use these models are categorized with the approaches or more specifically learning techniques that we will seperate the problem into and at the same time dataset is also will change accordingly, for example for supervised there will be levels while for unsupervised there won't be any level columns

# Unsupervised Approach
- Autoencoders
- Variational Autoencoders
- Weiners VAE (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.15860.pdf)
- t-SNE
- UMAP
- Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs)
- Hierarchical Clustering 
- Transfer learning
- Moduler deep learning
- Tensor Decomposition
  - Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD)
  - Tensor Train Decomposition (TTD)
  - Tensor Tucker Decomposition
- Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)

# Semi-supervised Approach
